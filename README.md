## TODO
We still need to do the following when we get a chance on Marcus' admin account:
- Change 'source' to the default branch

# Branches
- source is the default branch, which includes all files necessary for development. You should only pull down and work on this branch.
- develop is the branch that the source branch publishes to. To publish to develop, run `npm run deploy`.
