    <p>I grew up in Raleigh, North Carolina, with regular visits to family in Miami, Florida.  After graduating from Duke University with a B.A. in Philosophy and Ancient Greek, summa cum laude,  I completed an M.A. and Ph.D. at the Program in Classical Philosophy in the Department of Philosophy at Princeton University. My current  research focuses on the roles of reason and passion in human life at its  best in the writings of Aristotle and of Thomas Aquinas.</p>
    <p>I have taught courses in ancient philosophy at both Rutgers University and Princeton University, and this fall I am teaching a freshman seminar at Princeton on happiness and human nature in the Catholic intellectual tradition.</p>
